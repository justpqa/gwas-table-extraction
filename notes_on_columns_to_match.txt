- Remove all columns that mentions details for some other columns
- Remove all columns that is version 2 or 2nd copy of sth (RA1 and RA2 => single RA)
- Remove study type, stage, model, platform type because that interfere with multiindex column, both can be derived from the paper
- Effect size: add info about hazard ratio
- Update more detailed description of locus to separate them with SNPid and location
- Update more precised description of interaction terms
- Might not keep record type since it can be derived from columns like SNP id, chr
- pubmed, paper, table id can be derived directly, as well as notes
- Remove case and control since it can be derived based on specific rule, need more clarification
- Remove View in GenomicsDB since it need scraping from GenomicsDB on specific gene
- Remove interaction since it can be derived from notes on the column if having there
- Remove imputation since it can ve derived via papers
- Imputation/Stage/association type/model type/meta joint can be derived from other scripts?
- Keep CI definition here Confidence Interval,"The uncertainty range of the effect size. Keywords: 95% CI, L95, U95, Range. Examples: (1.20-1.75), [0.85, 0.95], 95% CI: 0.4-0.6.",TRUE
